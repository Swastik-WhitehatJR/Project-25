# ABOUT THE PROJECT
This contains the files that were edited and coded in the Project 25 in WhitehatJR Pro Course. It has a physics based paper object in which you can apply force using your arrow keys in all directions. Also there is a static dustbin in which you need to throw your paper. It is coded in javascript using "matter.js". To change the logic, edit the code in the file 'sketch.js' file.
